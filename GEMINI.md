# Project Overview

This is a single-page portfolio website for Ruchit Koshiya, a Unity Developer. It is a static website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses Bootstrap for styling and the ScrollReveal library for animations.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

There are no explicit development conventions, but the code is well-formatted and easy to read. The website is divided into sections, and each section has its own corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The project structure is as follows:

*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.
*   `assets/css/style.css`: The main stylesheet.
*   `assets/js/script.js`: The main JavaScript file.
*   `assets/images/`: Contains all the images used in the website.
